31.14	54.3	<font color='darkgreen'>The man is love personified. He has a sweet, softly loving, endearing smile. He has a voice that can range from eerie, effortless menace -- menace educational and creative -- to this low, cradling,</font>	Transcription
54.66	58.53	<font color='darkgreen'>insinuating, and involving love.</font>	Transcription
58.98	79.2	<font color='darkgreen'>This love is at once both father and son to a massive concern. A concern for his own people, surely. But for the cleansing the extension of all the world's categories, no less surely, since he knows</font>	Transcription
79.26	88.5	<font color='darkgreen'>surely that the fortunes of <i>these over here</i> affect inevitably, the fortunes of <i>those over there</i>.</font>	Transcription
89.76	113.43	<font color='darkgreen'>Essayist, novelist, poet, playwright, new French Legion of Honor medalist (and he was at that time), human being, being human! And I said James Baldwin, and the crowd went wild! Angela Jackson is an</font>	Transcription
113.43	121.86	<font color='darkgreen'>experimenter. She respects many people, but she long ago decided not to sound like them.</font>	Transcription
122.79	141.54	<font color='darkgreen'>So she ended up sounding like Angela Jackson. So many little twists and turns in her work. Rarely are you prepared for them. So many satisfying perceptions of actuals, we recognize remember, or are</font>	Transcription
141.54	162.54	<font color='darkgreen'>now ready to learn. Such impudent portraits of people. People she paints or invents. Such combos of colloquial and obscure, bound to confound and delight. And I say: well, here is something different</font>	Transcription
162.93	164.01	<font color='darkgreen'>for your dinner.</font>	Transcription
164.76	183.93	<font color='darkgreen'>I hope there are some award givers in the audience here. You remember these names. Michael Harper believes that delight is possible for the reader, as well as the creator of poetry. Believes that the</font>	Transcription
183.93	200.82	<font color='darkgreen'>reader, when permitted, participates in the act of creation, extending often this wonder of making within the limits, of course, of individual experience and fantasy.</font>	Transcription
201.48	222.45	<font color='darkgreen'>Well, Michael Harper is right there to cooperate with this need of the reader. Further, in much of his poetry, he has defied the Orthodox, the alien, the prescribed, the timid, and the dim. His work</font>	Transcription
222.45	239.43	<font color='darkgreen'>with language is various and respectful. Here is the author of the classic <I>A Mother Speaks: The Algiers Motel Incident, Detroit</i>, and of other shapely and persuasive excellences.</font>	Transcription
239.64	257.19	<font color='darkgreen'>And he did read that poem yesterday. I was just sitting there, daring him to omit it, as he often does. Because I think that's my favorite among the poems that he has written. And I'm so glad that I</font>	Transcription
257.19	269.16	<font color='darkgreen'>didn't have to shout up from the audience for Rita to read <i>The Island Women of Paris</i>, which among all of her many rich poems is my favorite. Thank you.</font>	Transcription
271.08	296.58	<font color='darkgreen'>Now let's see now. I have -- I had six Chicano poets: Sandra Cisneros, Luis Omar Salinas, Alberto Ríos, and Lorna Dee Cervantes. But I'm not going to read those notes. I wanted to, but we don't have</font>	Transcription
296.61	298.23	<font color='darkgreen'>that much time.</font>	Transcription
299.46	316.26	<font color='darkgreen'>Because I do want you to hear some of my poetry. There are people here, I'm sure, who have never heard a single one of my poems. Before I come to Haki and Sonia, I can't resist reading this little</font>	Transcription
316.29	322.89	<font color='darkgreen'>squib that introduced Louis Simpson. Do many of you know Louis Simpson?</font>	Transcription
324.45	339.81	<font color='darkgreen'>I started out by saying: Something wicked, this way comes. Here comes Louis Simpson -- He was sitting there getting redder and redder as he listened to this -- Here comes Louis Simpson, communicator</font>	Transcription
339.81	361.92	<font color='darkgreen'>of intricate darkness of feeling and instinct. So says Donald Hall. Firey defender of Gary Snyder, accused universally. Certain circles cite him as coldly capable of exhaustive wickedness.</font>	Transcription
363.63	382.62	<font color='darkgreen'>Not I, I didn't say so. For almost two decades, he has been soundly spanked for opining that if blacks write only about Blackness, they are inadequate. That they are, in fact, non-poets.</font>	Transcription
384.12	401.58	<font color='darkgreen'>You decide for yourselves whether or not that's wicked. But I myself found out how dangerous Simpson the savior can be. I remember with delight that years ago, at Stony Brook, I was having a lovely</font>	Transcription
401.58	423.63	<font color='darkgreen'>peaceful lunch with this poet and teacher, in a cheerfully sunny room, when I made the quotes, &quot;mistake&quot;, end quotes, of saying that there were no Grrrreat (capital G and lots of Rs), Grrrreat poets,</font>	Transcription
424.98	427.32	<font color='darkgreen'>living and writing today.</font>	Transcription
427.56	448.8	<font color='darkgreen'>That was some years ago. What we -- that we know of, that is, because of course there is always some unknown genius, toiling at the top of a tenement, about to burst full-bodied and beautiful and</font>	Transcription
448.8	459.15	<font color='darkgreen'>persuasive upon the populace. &quot;No great poets? Gary Snyder!&quot;, screamed Louis.</font>	Transcription
460.35	481.47	<font color='darkgreen'>He turned red -- he can do that -- and lifting himself to hellish height in his chair, bit my head off. And I said in parentheses, that is why I have no head. Oh well. Wicked or not, Lewis Simpson,</font>	Transcription
481.56	495.06	<font color='darkgreen'>poet of careful subjectivity, poet of luminous requiring lyricism, is here tonight. (And I wave to you).   [[00:07:50 | 00:07:52 | Laughter]] [[00:08:11 | 00:08:17 |Applause]]</font>	Transcription
498.84	517.68	<font color='darkgreen'>Haki Madhubuti and Sonia Sanchez, they came together. The introducing is longer tonight because I have a double introduction, and one that seeks to put some things in place. Both these poets at times</font>	Transcription
517.71	519.63	<font color='darkgreen'>have been called racists.</font>	Transcription
520.77	538.17	<font color='darkgreen'>I define racism as prejudice <i>with</i> oppression. That is, you are permitted to detest green eyes. That's all right. That's personal. What you are not permitted to do is kill every green eyed</font>	Transcription
538.17	550.02	<font color='darkgreen'>individual you encounter. That's not all right. That's oppression. These two people are not killers.</font>	Transcription
550.53	567.54	<font color='darkgreen'>They are lovers of humanity: of what is human. They are interpreters and protectors of Blackness. They are subscribers to what is beautiful in the world. They will offer you representative Black</font>	Transcription
567.54	577.65	<font color='darkgreen'>poetry. My saying that does not assault our mutual understanding that there are respectable Black uniquities.</font>	Transcription
578.07	596.7	<font color='darkgreen'>However, today many Black poets are flopping off in worrisome directions. Many of them do not know what to do or be. Many of them want above all things not to be Black. Black people who want above all</font>	Transcription
596.7	608.67	<font color='darkgreen'>things not to be Black are the most pitiable and comical people in the world.</font>	Transcription
608.67	628.23	<font color='darkgreen'>The poets among such fight Blackness with every punch and pout in their power. Such people are very busy imitating the new moderns: those manufacturers of chopped-up journalism, dazed and dopey.</font>	Transcription
629.01	646.74	<font color='darkgreen'>Such people have been fondled and adopted by non-spunky white poets and critics who of course have no interest in preserving and in firming the bolts, the binders of Blackness. They would like</font>	Transcription
646.74	649.44	<font color='darkgreen'>Blackness to disappear altogether.</font>	Transcription
651.27	666.45	<font color='darkgreen'>Insert: &quot;Oh, dear!&quot; I know history may repeat itself. Do you know -- well you'll be able to tell just when this was written, and I told you in 1985.</font>	Transcription
667.44	689.46	<font color='darkgreen'>Do you know that precious past election story about Jesse Jackson? He was crossing a large body of water in a small boat with the Pope. It was windy. Suddenly the Pope's little cap flew off his head.</font>	Transcription
691.36	710.92	<font color='darkgreen'>Then Jesse Jackson stepped out of the boat, walked across the water -- I can tell some of you know this story -- retrieved the cap, walked back, clapped the cap on the Pope's head.</font>	Transcription
711.76	736.06	<font color='darkgreen'>Next morning, the newspaper streamers proclaimed: Jesse Jackson can't swim. Well ultimately, in all my non-grandeur, I may see captions announcing &quot;When Brooks calls all white critics non-spunky&quot;.</font>	Transcription

739.57	759.55	<font color='darkgreen'>However, Sonia Sanchez is an explorer. I have always thought of her as one of that quintet of Black people: herself, Mari Evans, Don L. Lee, who became Haki, Etheridge Knight, and Nikki Giovanni who</font>	Transcription
759.55	760.96	<font color='darkgreen'>is here in this audience.</font>	Transcription
762.64	785.32	<font color='darkgreen'>Who -- and she's going to read next -- who admired the impudent spirit of Baraka, and who themselves began, in '66 and '67, to turn Black poetry around. I do not mean that these people suddenly</font>	Transcription
785.32	794.44	<font color='darkgreen'>spurted up in those years. They were all writing voluminously when I met them, and they were publishing too.</font>	Transcription
794.95	813.7	<font color='darkgreen'>Dudley Randall, poet and founder of Broadside Press, courageously published, platformed them all. In the late '60s, the quintet tried to do something fresh: defining Black poetry as poetry written by</font>	Transcription
813.7	819.64	<font color='darkgreen'>blacks, about blacks, to blacks. I am not accountable for any changes.</font>	Transcription
821.47	852.64	<font color='darkgreen'>In the late '60s that word &quot;to&quot; has been wickedly translated often into &quot;for&quot;. Any poetry... is for any readers or listeners willing to investigate it. I believe all factions should be willing to</font>	Transcription
852.64	854.44	<font color='darkgreen'>investigate Black poetry.</font>	Transcription
854.68	877.84	<font color='darkgreen'>Black people, I think will be around forever. Anyone is likely to meet them suddenly. Border, boardroom, boulevard, bistro, back-alley, bar. And it behooveth the anyone to know what makes the brie</font>	Transcription

883.3	901.18	<font color='darkgreen'>Sonia and Haki have remained loyal to their early recreated essence. They like the word &quot;Consistent&quot;. Sonia can be mischievous. She called me up a while ago -- remember this was in '85 -- and said,</font>	Transcription
901.24	909.61	<font color='darkgreen'>Gwen, I want your permission to use the form you used in the <i>Anniad</i>. In <i>Annie Allen</i>.</font>	Transcription
909.79	927.7	<font color='darkgreen'>I told her, in no way does Sonia Sanchez need my permission to do anything she wants to do. But Sonia, that is not my form. It's European. And that was mischievous because in those days, anything</font>	Transcription
927.73	935.62	<font color='darkgreen'>European was absolutely anathema.   [[00:15:33 | 00:15:33 | Cough]]</font>	Transcription
935.65	954.97	<font color='darkgreen'>The language of Sonia Sanchez is --skipped something. Even poets, these two are least likely to flop back into the '40s. The language of Sonia Sanchez is her own best introduction. Of course, one of</font>	Transcription
954.97	967.09	<font color='darkgreen'>her serious and inclusive avowals is this: If you're going out to say something, your house must be in order, because there is so much disorder outside.</font>	Transcription
967.6	985.93	<font color='darkgreen'>You will experience in her product lyricism and steel. You will be aware of Sonia Sanchez as committed poet, energized woman, necessary black. Incidentally, the prize that I mentioned has already been</font>	Transcription
985.93	991.42	<font color='darkgreen'>given to both Mari Evans and Sonia in a preceding year.</font>	Transcription
991.99	1015.75	<font color='darkgreen'>About Haki, pioneer. Haki respects Sonia and she respects him, as artist and as family. Those who love and those who loathe Haki agree that he has remained actively loyal to the richness of his faith</font>	Transcription
1015.84	1018.75	<font color='darkgreen'>in and love for Black people.</font>	Transcription
1019.23	1037.59	<font color='darkgreen'>He spanks them now and then, but only as a benevolent father would spank them aching in his awareness of how much there is to hurt them in themselves and outside themselves. Aching in his wish that</font>	Transcription
1037.59	1059.28	<font color='darkgreen'>they maintain integrity, and a decent family loyalty. He has influenced thousands of poets: Black poets, Hispanic poets, and strangely, you may feel, Caucasian poets, who sensed a vibrance, a vigor in</font>	Transcription
1059.28	1064.02	<font color='darkgreen'>his dealings with language which they came to admire.</font>	Transcription
1064.74	1082.35	<font color='darkgreen'>Haki has said, &quot;What writers write about tells to what extent they are involved with the real world. Writers should be questioners of the world and doers within the world. Question everything, and</font>	Transcription
1082.35	1102.99	<font color='darkgreen'>don't be satisfied with the quick surface answers. Bad writing, containing the most revolutionary idea, is first and last bad writing. The ability to develop a style that is clear, original, and</font>	Transcription
1102.99	1108.87	<font color='darkgreen'>communicative is what separates writers from non-writers&quot;, end quote.</font>	Transcription
1109.68	1131.22	<font color='darkgreen'>Haki had, 10 years ago, a famous list of Black clichés he wanted to see in Black poetry not again. I think he would endorse that list today. Warrior, ebony, whitey, Queen of the Nile, right on -- you</font>	Transcription
1131.22	1149.1	<font color='darkgreen'>know, I never hear that anymore -- African warrior, pig, pride, soul, universe, Cosmas, nigger, genocide, vibrations, Black is Beautiful, revolution, respect, change.</font>	Transcription
1149.79	1174.21	<font color='darkgreen'>And then I had such fun in ending that, &quot;Here is Haki Madhubuti, pssst... African Warrior&quot;. Well okay. those are people, insufficiently sung. Who should be sung. And I leave the audience to do</font>	Transcription
